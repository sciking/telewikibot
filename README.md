# telewikibot

## Why this crap?
Because I need an easy tool for my Raspberry Pi to make repetitive articles on Wikipedia.

## How it works?
It uses Telepot for reciving commands and Pywikibot for writing articles. So install telepot and pywiki.

## What can I do?
You can write a lot of identical articles and make the list with Telegram.

## Other?
Yep, you can add a suffix at the input.
